<h1 align="center"> Jetpack Compose Google Map </h1>

Explore the dynamic capabilities of [Jetpack Compose](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwirxJ-8nJGAAxWezMIEHZm2DusYABACGgJwdg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESa-D2E9EHPMO24ZVeohcQzPgBKtfVfkbnufBlV2qUiGJ5XL1vhNoQ7Yyk9acePAcC0Xrx3KvcDy_b5pvHL3nlRFYBNebz9_mLYiGTkq45DFvSST2UrzbFYFcZWc4RNKcXC6Bs884F7_fCsX0t&sig=AOD64_1j28Y5zCwhCJe_uPcFZYyLdXxP9Q&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjD8Zm8nJGAAxXPFzQIHcrGDR4Q0Qx6BAgKEAE&nis=8) in the realm of mapping with this open-source project. The "Jetpack Compose Google Map" provides a comprehensive demonstration of integrating Google Maps seamlessly into Jetpack Compose applications. 

This project serves as a valuable resource for developers diving into Jetpack Compose, offering practical examples of incorporating mapping features seamlessly. Whether you're building a location-based app or simply exploring the possibilities of Jetpack Compose, this showcase provides insights and code snippets to accelerate your development journey.

You can read the step-by-step guide in my [medium]() story.

## üí∞ Bonus Knowledge

In this project, we have utilized [TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs) as a configuration file format for managing `Gradle dependencies and plugins`. TOML provides a clean and easy-to-read syntax, making it simpler to manage and maintain the project's dependencies.

By using a TOML file, we can define and organize our Gradle dependencies and plugins in a structured manner. This approach enhances the `readability and maintainability` of our build configuration.

The TOML file in this project serves as a `centralized location` to specify the required dependencies and plugins, ensuring consistency across different build scripts. By utilizing TOML, we have streamlined the process of managing dependencies and plugins, making the project more efficient and easier to maintain.

Here is a basic example of what you can achieve with TOML:

## From

```
// Top-level `build.gradle.kts` file
plugins {
   id("com.android.application") version "7.4.1" apply false

}

// Module-level `build.gradle.kts` file
plugins {
   id("com.android.application")

}
dependencies {
    implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.9.0")

}
```

## To
```
// Top-level build.gradle.kts
plugins {
   alias(libs.plugins.android.application) apply false

}

// module build.gradle.kts
plugins {
   alias(libs.plugins.android.application)

}
dependencies {
   implementation(libs.androidx.ktx)

}
```

## By adding code like this in libs.versions.toml
```
[versions]
ktx = "1.9.0"
androidGradlePlugin = "7.4.1"

[libraries]
androidx-ktx = { group = "androidx.core", name = "core-ktx", version.ref = "ktx" }

[plugins]
android-application = { id = "com.android.application", version.ref = "androidGradlePlugin" }

```

Feel free to explore the `TOML configuration file` in this project and adapt the approach to fit your own build management needs. You can find this file in project `gradle` folder with this name `libs.versions.toml`.
